        "Create a complete, runnable Google Colab notebook in Python that implements an Agentic AI Traffic Controller for a hackathon demo. The system should simulate processing traffic images from a folder every 20 seconds, use YOLOv8 to detect and count vehicles (categorized as cars, buses, trucks, bikes, emergency vehicles), estimate congestion by rows of vehicles per lane, and detect emergency vehicles. It should then use Gemini to make real-time, dynamic decisions about traffic light states (red/green) for a 4-way intersection based on congestion levels and emergency vehicle priority, outputting the final traffic light states every 20 seconds without displaying timers. The system must include an internal assessment loop that continuously re-analyzes new images and adjusts signals. Assume traffic images are available in a local folder named \"traffic_images\"."
